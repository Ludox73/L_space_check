This is a code that can be used to (try to) check if a manifold (given as a snappy manifold) is an L-space.
There is no guarantee that the code gives an answer in a finite amount of time. When the answer is True,
it is rigorous; when it is False, it is not.

The main function is the function is_certified_L_space. To read several examples
of how it works, see the Jupyter worksheet
