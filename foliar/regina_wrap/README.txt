Code for exposing Regina's exploration of the space of all possible
triangulations on the Python side.  Assuming you have Regina installed
in the location indicated in "setup.py" (e.g. if you are using the
computop/sage Docker image), then the following will build, install,
and test this module::

  sage -pip install .
  sage -python test.py
  sage -python new_util.py
